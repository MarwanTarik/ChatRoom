# Proof of Concept for Firebase Services Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of key Firebase services for mobile and web applications. The main features covered in this Proof of Concept (PoC) are:

### Firebase Realtime Database
Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL cloud database that allows storing and syncing data in real-time across all connected clients. It enables the creation of interactive and collaborative applications where data is instantly available to all users, ensuring real-time updates and synchronization.

### Cloud Firestore
Cloud Firestore is a flexible and scalable NoSQL database from Firebase that supports mobile, web, and server applications. It allows structured data storage with rich querying capabilities and real-time synchronization. Firestore enables applications to store large datasets with complex queries and scalability in mind.

### Firebase Authentication
Firebase Authentication provides a complete identity solution for managing users. 
It supports various sign-in methods including email/password authentication, phone authentication, and third-party providers like Google and Facebook. This PoC includes sign-up, sign-in, and account management functionalities, ensuring a seamless experience for users to authenticate and manage their accounts.

### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) enables sending push notifications and messages to users across different platforms. This feature is used for delivering timely updates, alerts, or messages to users' devices. It supports both foreground and background notifications, providing a comprehensive messaging solution for real-time communication.
