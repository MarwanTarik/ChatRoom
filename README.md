# Proof of Concept for Firebase Services Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of key Firebase services for mobile and web applications. It covers the following Firebase features:

- **Firebase Realtime Database**: A NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing data in real-time across all clients.
- **Cloud Firestore**: A flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development.
- **Firebase Authentication**: A complete identity solution for managing users, supporting sign-up, sign-in, and account management.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: A cross-platform messaging solution for sending push notifications to users.

This PoC serves as a foundational example for integrating these Firebase services to build robust, real-time applications with user authentication and push notification capabilities.
